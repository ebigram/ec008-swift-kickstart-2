This material was originally published as part of "A Swift Kickstart". It was last updated in September, 2017 with the release of Swift 4.0. It was not updated with the release of Swift 4.1 in March, 2018 and much of it will be dated with the release of Swift 4.2.

I added it to the book a couple of years ago but it never felt as if it belonged.

This folder contains the epub and mobi versions of the chapter and the Xcode playgrounds.

In the code folder are the before and after folders for the chapter code for Xcode on the Mac. This code was last checked in Xcode 9.2, Swift 4.
